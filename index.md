## About Me

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aHTx99DMBE7vandcKv1oCWEwGulrrBrG/preview" width="30%" height="200px" style="border:none;"></iframe>



My name is Alex Jenkins,

I am a current junior attending Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. I love experimenting with how different systems interplay with each other, as well as pursuing robotics, automobiles, and aerospace. I was the co-lead of the Sportsman subteam at Combat Robotics @ Cornell and now serve as the new member training lead. I love the competition aspect of the team, as well as the community and teamwork that is implemented in build sessions.

Some non-technical things about me: I love to read, I'm an F1 fan, and I've been a sailing instructor at Cornell University since my freshman spring (2023). I love being outdoors and on the water, and I enjoy meeting new people and sharing my love of sailing with them.
