## About Me


<img src="/_projects/ProfilePhoto.JPG" alt="Profile Picture" style="width:200px; border-radius:10px;" />


 
My name is Alex Jenkins,

I am a current junior attending Cornell University Studying Mechanical Engineering. Who loves experimenting with how different systems interplay with each other as well as pursuing robotics, automobiles and Aerospace. I was the co-lead of the Sportsman subteam at Combat Robotics @ Cornell and now the new member training lead. I love the competition aspect of the team as well as the community and teamwork that is implemented in build sessions.
Some non technical things about me are that I love to read, I'm an F1 fan, and I have been a sailing instructor at Cornell University since my freshmen spring (2023): I love to be outdoors and on the water as well as meet new people and share my love of sailing with them.
